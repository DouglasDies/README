Some info about me and what I am looking to accomplish! 

I am currently a Student completing a Bachelors in Information Technology with emphasis on Software development. I will be updating this as I move along in my career, and as of now I am set to graduate January 1st of 2023.

I am currently looking for work in IT and/or software development.

I will be placing any small project I complete showing my competency in different languages/skills within my github Repositories to show to employers or anyone else attempting to learn how to code and/or looking for similar work.

If you want to reach out and contact me, the best way is through email which will be listed on the following line.
